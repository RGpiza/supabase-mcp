# Progress

## What Works

- **MemoryBank.md**: Core documentation structure and workflows defined
- **projectbrief.md**: Project scope and requirements documented
- **productContext.md**: Product vision and user experience goals captured
- **systemPatterns.md**: Technical architecture and design patterns documented
- **techContext.md**: Technologies and development environment documented
- **activeContext.md**: Current work and context documented
- **progress.md**: Project status and accomplishments documented
- **Verification**: All required files present and properly structured

## What's Left to Build

- **MemoryBank Integration**: Implement automated tools to read and update MemoryBank files
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Establish procedures for keeping MemoryBank current
- **Validation System**: Create checks to ensure MemoryBank completeness and consistency

## Current Status

The MemoryBank system has been successfully initialized with all required core files. The documentation foundation is now in place to support Cline's memory continuity between sessions. All hierarchical relationships between files are properly established according to the MemoryBank.md specification. The MemoryBank is ready for use and will be updated as development progresses.

## Known Issues

- No known issues with the current MemoryBank implementation
- Manual maintenance required until automated tools are implemented

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The MemoryBank initialization followed the hierarchical structure defined in MemoryBank.md, ensuring each file builds upon the previous ones. The implementation prioritizes clarity and completeness to serve as a reliable foundation for future development work. The MemoryBank system is now fully functional and ready to support Cline's documentation needs.
