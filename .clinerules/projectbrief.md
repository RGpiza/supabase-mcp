# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

This project is a Roblox incremental game called "System Incremental" that simulates a computer system management experience. The game allows players to build, upgrade, and manage various computer components to generate data and progress through the game.

## Project Scope

### Core Game Systems
- **Resource Management**: Data generation and accumulation system
- **Upgrade System**: CPU, RAM, and Storage upgrades with branching paths
- **Prestige System**: Reset-based progression with permanent upgrades
- **Automation**: Auto-purchase and production systems
- **Economy**: In-game currency and monetization features

### Technical Architecture
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Roblox-based game with server-side logic
- **Data Persistence**: Player data storage and retrieval
- **Modular Design**: Service-based architecture using InitManager
- **UI System**: Dynamic user interface for game interactions

### Development Standards
- **Code Organization**: All code under `/src` directory
- **No Unnecessary Comments**: Clean, self-documenting code
- **Service Pattern**: Modular services for different game systems
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging

## Project Goals

1. **Complete Core Systems**: Implement all essential game mechanics
2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth gameplay with efficient code
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Design for future feature additions
4. **Player Experience**: Create engaging and addictive gameplay loop

## Success Criteria

- All core game systems functional and integrated
- Clean, maintainable codebase following established patterns
- Proper error handling and logging throughout
- Performance optimized for Roblox platform
- Ready for testing and iteration
