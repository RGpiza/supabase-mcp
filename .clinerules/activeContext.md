# Active Context

## Current Work

MemoryBank system has been successfully initialized. All core documentation files have been created and the hierarchical structure is complete. Currently updating the MemoryBank to reflect the completed initialization and current project status.

## Key Technical Concepts

- **MemoryBank Architecture**: Hierarchical documentation system with core files building upon each other
- **Project Documentation**: Structured approach to maintaining project knowledge
- **Session Continuity**: Ensuring Cline can pick up work seamlessly after memory resets
- **Documentation Standards**: Following established patterns for consistent information organization

## Relevant Files and Code

- **MemoryBank.md**
  - Defines the overall MemoryBank structure and requirements
  - Specifies core files needed: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md
  - Outlines workflows for Plan Mode and Act Mode

- **projectbrief.md**
  - Foundation document defining core requirements and goals
  - Created during this session to establish project scope
  - Source of truth for project scope and success criteria

- **productContext.md**
  - Documents why the project exists and problems it solves
  - Defines user experience goals for different player types
  - Created during this session to capture product vision

- **systemPatterns.md**
  - Documents system architecture and technical decisions
  - Created during this session to capture technical patterns
  - Defines component relationships and critical implementation paths

- **techContext.md**
  - Documents technologies, constraints, and dependencies
  - Created during this session to capture technical environment
  - Includes performance considerations and tool usage patterns

## Problem Solving

Successfully implemented the MemoryBank hierarchical structure by creating all required core files. Each file builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive documentation foundation for project continuity.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ **MemoryBank.md**: Core documentation structure and workflows defined
- ✅ **projectbrief.md**: Project scope and requirements documented  
- ✅ **productContext.md**: Product vision and user experience goals captured
- ✅ **systemPatterns.md**: Technical architecture and design patterns documented
- ✅ **techContext.md**: Technologies and development environment documented
- ✅ **activeContext.md**: Current work and context documented
- ✅ **progress.md**: Project status and accomplishments documented
- ✅ **Verification**: All required files present and properly structured

## Next Steps

- **Establish maintenance procedures**: Define how to keep the MemoryBank updated during development
- **Integration planning**: Consider how to integrate MemoryBank reading into Cline's startup workflow
- **Documentation refinement**: Continuously improve documentation as the project evolves
